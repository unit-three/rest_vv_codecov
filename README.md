Testing and test-driven development is a good way to continue this journey following on from the learning materials.  

The very nature of being able to effectively collaborate using Git via GitHub is a delicate skill in and of itself.  

Checkpoints mentioned:
1) **Getting Started**: Simple testing suite for flask app.py from learning materials.

2)  **Pete's Challenge:** Setup our fork of openvar/rest_variantValidator.  From this Fork submit pull-request with 1 valid test. 

3) **100% codecov :** Continue creating tests together and aim to  get codecov into the green and ideally 100% for openvar/rest_variantValidator via a fork.

### This repo 'rest_vv_codecov' is Checkpoint 1. Getting Started.
